"""Column-major dword-packed storage shared by all constraint types.

All constraint state (ball-socket anchors, hinge axes, motor velocities,
contact normals, ...) lives in a *single* ``wp.array2d[wp.float32]``
shaped ``(num_dwords, num_constraints)`` -- column-major-by-cid. Each
column is one constraint's flat dword image; rows pick out individual
fields. With ``cid`` along the warp's lane axis, every per-field load
in a partitioned PGS kernel is a fully coalesced 128-byte transaction:
32 lanes hit the same row, consecutive columns, contiguous in memory.

The dword offsets for each field are derived once at module load via
:func:`newton._src.solvers.jitter.data_packing.dword_offset_of` from
the per-type ``@wp.struct`` schemas. The struct is *only* a schema --
runtime kernels never instantiate it; they read/write individual fields
via the typed accessors built on top of the helpers in this module.

Multiple constraint types share one container by allocating
``num_dwords = max(BS_DWORDS, AM_DWORDS, ...)`` rows; constraint
indices are global across types and a per-cid type tag (TBD when more
types land) tells the dispatcher which kernel to launch on which
partition. The wasted dwords are a flat tax for type-mixing
flexibility.
